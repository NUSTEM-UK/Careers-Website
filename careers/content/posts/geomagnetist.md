Geomagnetists are a specialist type of geologist who study the magnetic processes of geological features and the Earth as a whole. They study the geomagnetism caused by the Earth spinning on its axis as it orbits the sun and the magnetic processes caused by mountain ranges, ocean trenches and shifting tectonics which effect on the geomagnetic field of the Earth. This research informs the understanding of formation of the Earth and other planets. It is useful in industry as studying the magnetic fields of the Earth can help predict where resources might be situated.
