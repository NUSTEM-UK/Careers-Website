Optometrists were previously known as opticians and are trained to examine the eyes to detect defects in vision, signs of injury, ocular diseases or abnormality. They are also able to detect problems with general health, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. They make a health assessment, offer clinical advice, and prescribe spectacles or contact lenses. They refer patients to an ophthalmologist for further treatment when necessary.
