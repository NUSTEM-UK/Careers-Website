Botanists study plants including algae, fungi, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers and flowering plants. They study their physiological processes such as photosynthesis at the molecular level, the evolutionary history and relationships of plants, or their current relationships with their environments. They may focus on the agricultural applications of plants used for food, fuel, turf, and cover crops, studying their responses to stresses from pests, disease, and climate variations. They may study the conservation of native species, reducing the invasion of non-native exotic plants, and improving the clean air and erosion protection they provide. Their research is involved in enhancing crops, developing medicines, cleaning up contaminated sites, and even powering our cars.
