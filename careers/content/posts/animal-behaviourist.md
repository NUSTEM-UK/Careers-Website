Animal behaviourists apply the principles of animal behaviour science while studying how animals interact with each other and their environment. They research an animal’s methods of communication, instinctual responses, learning methods, psychology, and group interaction skills. They often work on veterinary referral, helping the owners of companion animals such as dogs, cats, horses, rabbits and birds resolve behavioural problems through diagnosis of the problem behaviour and application of an individual behaviour modification program.
