<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">Materials engineers research</span> <span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">materials used in industry, like carbon fibre reinforced plastic, polymers, ceramics or alloys, and test their behaviours under different conditions. Materials engineers understand the properties and behaviours of different substances, from raw materials to finished products and use non-destructive testing methods to investigate materials, like electrical conductivity, or tolerance to heat or corrosion. Materials engineers combine or modify materials in different ways to improve the performance, durability and cost-effectiveness of processes and products.</span></span>
