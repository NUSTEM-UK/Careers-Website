Electrical engineers focus on power generation and transmission processes to create and implement electrical systems. Electrical engineers develop devices that transmit signals such as GPS and radar and biomedical devices that allow physicians to accurately assess a patient's condition without an invasive procedure or fingerprint identification systems. They are at the forefront in developing new ways to use solar, wind, water, and other natural sources for power generation. Electrical engineers are investigating the feasibility of using superconductors to run all ship systems and create systems to ensure that satellites remain functional while orbiting the Earth.
