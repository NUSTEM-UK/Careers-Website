A naturalist is a type of biologist who studies the impacts of living species on each other and the environments in which they live. Naturalists are less concerned with genetics and more concerned with relationships. They look for evolutionary markers to explain why a certain attribute may have been beneficial or what environmental conditions may have led to the rise of genetic diversity within a species. The core of the work a naturalist does is in the field rather than in the lab, taking field notes, photographs and written records and compiling them for analysis.
