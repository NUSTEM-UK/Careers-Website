A conservation scientist is someone who manages the overall land quality of forests, parks, rangelands and other natural resources. They work with landowners to devise ways to use and improve the land while safeguarding the environment, for example, advising farmers on how they can improve their land for agricultural purposes and to help control erosion. Conservation scientists monitor forestry and conservation activities to assure compliance with government regulations, choose and prepare sites for new trees using controlled burning, bulldozers, or herbicides to clear land and monitoring forest-cleared lands to ensure they are suitable for future use.
