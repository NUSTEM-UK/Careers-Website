<span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">A soil scientist studies the upper few meters of the Earth’s crust in terms of its physical and chemical properties, distribution, genesis and morphology, and biological components. Soil scientists work in both the office and field. They analyse and determine the characteristics of different types of soils. Soil types are complex and the geographical areas a soil scientist may survey are varied. They use aerial photos and satellite images to research the areas and use computer and geographic information systems to analyse the geomorphology, topography, vegetation and climate to discover the patterns left on the landscape. Soil scientists often work in areas such as wetlands, conservation, crop consultant, farming or hydrology.</span></span>
