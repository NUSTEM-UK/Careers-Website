A sound engineer works specifically with the mechanical and technical aspects of recording, mixing, reproducing and manipulating the electronic effects of sound. They control microphones, sound levels and outputs along with their experience of acoustics to produce the best quality of sound suitable for purpose. Sound engineers don’t always work in music. There are specialist areas of sound engineering to become involved in, such as studio engineering, live sound engineering, game and audio design or audio post engineering which involves mixing and editing sound for television and movies.
