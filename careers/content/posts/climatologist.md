<span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">Climatologists are atmospheric scientists who study the Earth's climate. This is the long term weather pattern of a particular area. They collect and analyse data from sources such as ice cores, soil, water, air, and plant life to find patterns in weather and learn how those patterns affect the Earth and its inhabitants. Climatologists apply their research to address local climate issues or to determine how to work different in climate conditions. They work as weather forecasters, develop new measurement tools and statistical models, conduct simulations, and translate findings into more easily understood terms for the general public.</span></span>
