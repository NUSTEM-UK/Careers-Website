A mineralogist is a person who studies minerals,</span> <span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">their crystalline and chemical structures, and their properties such as melting points. Most mineralogists study minerals of economic value, such as metals like copper, aluminium, iron ore, gypsum and clays. They determine their physical and chemical properties, how to efficiently retrieve them from ores, and how to process them. They may performing chemical, heat, and other tests on samples to identify them or determine their properties. Mineralogists working for mining companies often work on enhancing the processing of minerals from ores and monitor sample collection, preparation, and analysis.
