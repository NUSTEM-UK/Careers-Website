Biostatisticians analyse data and statistics on living things collected during medical research studies to draw conclusions or make predictions. They work on methods in applied and theoretical statistics in order to advance the science of data analysis beyond current levels. They design biological experiments in agriculture and medicine. They collect, dissect, and summarize the data, and release information based on the findings of that data. During the execution of clinical trials, Biostatisticians monitor how the study is conducted to ensure that the integrity of the results won't be compromised.
