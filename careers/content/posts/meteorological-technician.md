Meteorological technicians are responsible for the collection of meteorological information. This includes observations of different elements such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, visibility and clouds by using various aids such as computers, radar and automatic weather stations. After a meteorological technician has checked all the information, it is sent to weather, air navigation and marine offices. Weather offices at airports are also manned by meteorological technicians.
