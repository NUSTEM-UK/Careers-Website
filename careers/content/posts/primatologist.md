Primatologists study non-human primates from biological, anthropological, psychological and perspectives and may work within biology, medical research, anthropology or zoology. Primatologists seek to observe human-like behaviours, explore primate psychology, or study primate culture. They may work in zoos and other domestic environments caring for the animals or observing their behaviours and habits in the wild. Some primatologists work in laboratories assessing the biological backgrounds of apes and other human-like primates.
