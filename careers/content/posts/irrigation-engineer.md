Irrigation is the process of transporting water safely from one location to another, usually for agricultural purposes. An irrigation engineer designs irrigation systems and oversees their construction or implementation. They construct irrigation systems such as dams, canals, and ditches, according to type of soil, climatic characteristics, water supply and return flow. If a system fails to work, or if performance is sluggish, the irrigation engineer will diagnose and fix the system. An irrigation engineer also conducts research on problems of soil drainage and conservation, applying knowledge of civil engineering.
