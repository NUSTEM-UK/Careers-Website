<span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">Product and process development scientists improve the efficiency and profitability of manufactured products. Process development scientists optimise the performance of manufacturing systems. They identify and develop new processes for product manufacture and implement process controls to ensure the products are of a high quality. Product development scientists work with research scientists to develop new ideas and scientific discoveries to be used in the manufacture of new products. They also develop and improve existing products.</span></span>
