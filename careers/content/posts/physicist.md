A physicist is a specialist in the science that deals with matter and energy and their interactions. Physicists can work in theoretical analysis, where they develop ideas using computer simulations and mathematical modelling techniques to make predictions and explain behaviours. They may also be involved in experimental research where they design experiments to test theories. There are many areas physicist may be involved in such as developing new medical instruments and treatments, exploring robotics and artificial intelligence or investigating new ways to generate power.
