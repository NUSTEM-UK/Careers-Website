Wildlife technicians assist with the management of wildlife species and the preservation of habitats. They assist wildlife biologists collecting biological specimens, surveying animal populations, compiling data for evaluation, maintaining and calibrating scientific equipment, and writing detailed reports. They may also be involved with trapping and tagging animals to monitor their movements within a designated area and evaluate their health, looking for signs of illness. Wildlife technicians provide care for animals that have been captured for observation in a laboratory setting. Additional duties may involve preserving animal habitats and maintaining roads and trails to keep the wildlife areas accessible.
