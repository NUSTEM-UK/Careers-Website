An environmental engineer is someone who uses the principles of engineering, soil science, biology, and chemistry to develop solutions to environmental problems. They use their scientific knowledge to design systems that control pollution and protect public health. Environmental engineers evaluate the significance an environmental hazard and advise on treating and containing it. They design municipal water supply and industrial wastewater treatment systems and research the environmental impact of proposed construction projects. Some environmental engineers study ways to minimise the effects of acid rain, global warming, automobile emissions, and ozone depletion.
