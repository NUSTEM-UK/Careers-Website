<span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">A herpetologist is a zoologist who studies reptiles and amphibians, looking at behaviours, geographic ranges, physiologies, development and genetics in order to understand their ecological niches, the ecosystem services they supply, and the challenges they face. Many herpetologists focus on conservation of these species while others use them to assess overall environmental conditions in a particular area. Herpetologists study animals in the wild, where they determine or assess potential threats from pollution, invasive species, disease, and other factors. Herpetologists plan and manage disease control and conservation programs and conduct environmental or wildlife impact studies. </span></span>
