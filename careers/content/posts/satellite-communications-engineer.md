Satellite communications engineers work with the satellite systems which enable wireless communication in regions where mobile networking is not cost-effective.  They design programs that direct orbiting satellites and keep them functioning as well as conducting testing of satellite communication systems. They may also work on projects such as NASA’s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite which provides continuous communication between astronauts in space and the ground base on Earth.

<strong>Attributes: </strong>committed, organised, resilient
