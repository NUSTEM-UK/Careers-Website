A bioprocessing engineer analyses and develops the systems used to manufacture biological products. They usually work in agricultural research and development companies, food processing plants, biotechnology firms, alternative fuel manufacturers, and pharmaceutical companies. A bioprocessing engineer works to improve efficiency, worker safety, and product quality. A lab engineer experiments with different biochemicals, such as those used in pharmaceuticals, observing their effects on bacteria or viruses under a microscope. A bioprocessing engineer in a manufacturing plant analyses the existing machinery and techniques used to make products to determine if they can be modified to increase production.
