Crystallographers study atomic and molecular structures. They work in many disciplines, including chemistry, geology, biology, materials science, metallurgy and physics. They study diverse substances such as living cells, protein molecules, superconductors and ceramics. Crystallographers use methods such as x-rays, atomic force microscopy, neutron diffraction, electron crystallography, molecular modelling and high-pressure diffraction in order to discover how the atoms in a material are arranged and understand the relationship between the atomic structure and the properties of these materials.
