An optical engineer researches and develops new technologies related to the science of light. They study the behaviour of light and see how it can be manipulated to enhance electronic systems and equipment. Optical engineers work in all areas of optics using different techniques to design lasers, build telescopes, create fibre optics communication systems or work with microscopes, computer chips or consumer electronics. This requires them to understand and apply the science of optics in substantial detail in order to know what is physically possible to achieve.
