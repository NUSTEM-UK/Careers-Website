Condensed matter physicists use the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics to study the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of matter. They are particularly concerned with the behaviour of this matter during condensed phases, the most familiar of these being solids and liquids. The study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties with experimental probes. Condensed matter physicists also use methods of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behaviour.
