<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">Engineering Geologists assess whether ground rock is stable enough and whether it is a safe type of rock on which to build. They also look at human developments that might affect the stability of the ground such as mine shafts or waste disposal sites in terms of gas leaks as well as ground stability.</span> <span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">Engineering geologists</span> <span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">also look at water sources, soil stability and other natural processes that could impact on a new development.</span> <span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">They use and analyse site information such as radar images, aerial photographs, reports and geological maps prior to site investigations.</span></span>
