Satellite engineers are involved in the development of satellites which are launched for specific purposes such as communications, atmospheric studies or navigation. They design satellite command systems that remotely control satellite activities from ground stations and keep satellites functioning properly. Satellite engineers also collect data that tracks satellite behaviour and write status reports.
