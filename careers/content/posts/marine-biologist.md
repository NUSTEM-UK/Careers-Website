Marine Biologists study all of the creatures that live in the oceans. They can choose to specialise in a specific area such as large ocean animals, all the way down to microscopic organisms. Marine biologists may look at how factors such as the weather, illness, pollution or over fishing affect marine organisms. Much of a Marine Biologist’s work involves research, observation and data collection, and may also involve scuba diving to collect specimens.
