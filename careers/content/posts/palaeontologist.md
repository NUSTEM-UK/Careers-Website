A palaeontologist is a scientist who studies the fossilized remains of all kinds of organisms (plants, animals, fungi, bacteria and other single-celled living things) and the relationships between extinct plants and animals and their living relatives today. They try to understand extinction events of the past and apply this to the modern world as environments and global climates change. The work of a palaeontologist includes collecting data and samples on field trips, examining and testing samples in the lab, recording and classifying samples and collections and giving talks and managing displays and exhibitions.
