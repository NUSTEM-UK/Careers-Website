Electrical technicians are responsible for designing, developing, testing, maintaining and repairing electrical wiring and equipment. Machinery used around the world such as computers, communication equipment, navigational devices and medical monitoring machines rely on the work of electrical technicians. Work can vary from dealing with circuit breakers and electrical wiring to working in research and development, conducting experiments, testing new designs, and collecting data. Others might specialise in computer programs, such as Computer Aided Design, in quality control or in aerospace testing flight equipment.
