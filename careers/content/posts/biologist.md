A Biologist is a scientist who studies life and seeks to gain a better understanding of relationships that humans, animals and bacteria have with their environment. Biologists use research to gather data about how the bodies of different organisms work and how environmental factors impact on this. They then use this information to make advancements in medicine, agriculture or industrial processes.
