<span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">A surgeon cuts the human body to remove diseased tissue or organs, to repair body systems, or to replace diseased organs with transplants. Surgeons correct physical deformities, repair bone and tissue after injuries, or perform preventive or elective surgeries on patients. Surgeons work with all types of tools, from scalpels to calipers and it is important that the surgeon fully understands all of the aspects of the tools used. Surgeons oversee the administration of medications as needed throughout the surgery and must be knowledgeable of the various types of medications used and the potential reactions when they operate on a patient.</span></span>
