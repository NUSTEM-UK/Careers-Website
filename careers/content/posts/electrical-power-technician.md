Electrical power technicians work in nuclear, coal, geothermal or hydroelectric power plants. They are responsible for controlling and monitoring all of the electrical equipment. Electrical power technicians control the amount of power by maintaining the electricity and voltage throughout the power plant. Technicians also use computer systems to adjust power levels and are able to connect and disconnect them from their circuits.
