An astrophysicist is a scientist who researches the principles of light, motion, and natural forces in order to gain an understanding underlying properties of the cosmos. They use theoretical and observational physics and chemistry to study the Sun, stars, galaxies and planets. Most astrophysicists specialise in a particular theory or phenomenon such as the origins and evolution of the solar system, black holes, the origin of cosmic rays or the development and extinction of stars.
