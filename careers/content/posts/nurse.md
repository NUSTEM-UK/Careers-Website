Nursing is generally regarded as a caring profession but the majority of a nurse's technical responsibilities involve an area of science. These duties may include monitoring, recording and reporting on patients' medical information, symptoms, vital signs and changes in patients' conditions including during anaesthesia. Nurses order, interpret, and evaluate diagnostic tests and may conduct specified laboratory tests. They are responsible for preparing sterile rooms, instruments and equipment and can prescribe or recommend medication or other treatment such as physiotherapy.
