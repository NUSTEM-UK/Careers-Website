Environmental scientists study the effects of human activities on the environment by conducting tests and analysing data in order to prevent and solve environmental problems. Environmental scientists gather samples and observational data in the field and conduct tests in the lab. They analyse, soil or air samples to find the type, concentration and source of the pollution caused by industry or agriculture. The environmental scientist will then identify if that contaminant source has the potential to affect or harm individuals and communities. They then identify ways to manage, minimise or eliminate any negative impacts of the pollution.
