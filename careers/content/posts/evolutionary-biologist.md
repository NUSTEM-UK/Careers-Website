Evolutionary biologists are specifically interested in knowing more about the evolution of plants and animals. They seek to discover more about the history of life on earth, how organisms have changed and developed over time and the causes of this evolution. They cover a vast range of work from looking at DNA in the lab to studying how individual species have evolved in a particular ecosystem.
