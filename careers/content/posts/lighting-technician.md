Lighting Technicians are also known as Lighting Operators or Lighting Electricians and they usually specialise in film and TV, or theatre, concerts and live events. Their work can range from basic spotlighting to operating strobes, lasers and pyrotechnics. They may be the only lighting technician on a theatre production, or part of a large crew on a concert tour or feature film. Duties can include setting up the lighting equipment before a shoot starts, carrying out lighting tests, programming and operating manual and computer-controlled lighting systems, or taking down the equipment after shows or filming.
