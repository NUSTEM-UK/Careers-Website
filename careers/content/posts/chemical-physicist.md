Chemical physicists study reactions and how two fields can interact with each other. They examine the structure of chemical particles, such as ions, molecules and polymers and explain why certain enzymes function due to their molecular shape. They watch how particle structure is altered when it goes through various chemical processes, such as combustion or sublimation. Chemical physicists test other reactions including energy-flow or the states of quantum particles.
