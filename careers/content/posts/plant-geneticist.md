Plant geneticists conduct research to improve existing plants and crops, as well as create new varieties of plants and crops. They improve characteristics of plants and crops, such as appearance, nutritional value, size, drought resistance and increased levels of disease tolerance. This is vital to the agricultural industry in order for market requirements and consumer demands to be met and to increase and maintain yields in important crops. The work of a plant geneticist includes crossing plants to produce new breeding material for field and glasshouse trials and analysing and scientifically assessing plant breeding in laboratory and field trials.
