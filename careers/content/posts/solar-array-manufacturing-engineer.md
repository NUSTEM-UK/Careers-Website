Solar Array Manufacturing Engineers are experts in utilising sunlight to generate electricity. They work on large arrays of solar panels which usually sit in ordered rows for example, in the desert. Solar array manufacturing engineers work in the manufacturing, construction, and maintenance of solar power materials and solar power plants. They may also work on developing low-cost solar panels for space applications.
