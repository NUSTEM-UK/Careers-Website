A meteorologist studies an aspect of the atmosphere and uses scientific principles to observe, understand and be able to explain or forecast how the earth's atmosphere affects the earth and everyone on it. In weather forecasting, meteorologist need to collect data from satellite images, radar, remote sensors and weather stations all over the world. They measure factors such as air pressure, temperature and humidity at various atmospheric levels and apply physical and mathematical relationships and sophisticated computer models to make short and long-range weather forecasts. Meteorologists may also monitor climate variability and change, research seasonal forecasting, ocean forecasting and climate prediction and apply the results of research in to give flood warnings or estimate the likely effects of global warming.
