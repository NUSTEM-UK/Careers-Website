Habitat Restoration Engineers are landscape planners working from an ecological perspective. They make ecological alternations to a landscape to return it to a former state, usually for ecological repair or conservation reasons. Habitat Restoration Engineers examine and identify the ways that human actions or natural events put pressure on ecology and the wider ecosystem. They identify the potential hazards and damages that they cause. They work with a variety of environmental scientists such as ecological planners, geologists, botanists, herpetologists and ornithologists on the engineering of new landscapes and recreation of ancient landscapes.
