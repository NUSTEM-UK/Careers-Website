Astronomers are a type of scientist that study objects in space. There are two types of astronomers. Observational astronomers collect data from satellites and spacecraft using radio and optical telescopes, develop new instruments to gather information and develop software to analyse and interpret data. Theoretical Astronomers develop theories on the physical processes happening in space and analyse data to help develop our understanding of events in the universe.
