A geophysicist is someone who studies the Earth using gravity, magnetic, electrical, and seismic methods. They assist the oil and gas industries by creating a picture of what lies below the earth's surface by collecting data on seismic waves, which move through and around the earth. Geophysicists are responsible for controlling the quality of the seismic data collected and interpreting it in order to create maps of the build-up of hydrocarbons. They examine the physical properties of rocks, as well as gathering data in order evaluate areas for environmental hazards or to build dams and construction sites.
