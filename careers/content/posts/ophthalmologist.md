An ophthalmologist is a medical or osteopathic doctor who specialises in eye and vision care. Ophthalmologists differ from optometrists in what they can diagnose and treat as an ophthalmologist is licensed to practice medicine and surgery. An ophthalmologist diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and performs eye surgery. They also prescribe and fit eyeglasses and contact lenses to correct vision problems. Many ophthalmologists are also involved in scientific research on the causes and cures for eye diseases and vision disorders, or specialise in areas such as glaucoma, the retina or cornea, pediatrics or neurology.
