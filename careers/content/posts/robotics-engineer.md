A robotics engineer is responsible for creating robots and robotic systems that are able to perform duties that humans are unable or prefer not to complete. They design and build robots that help to make jobs safer, easier, and more efficient, particularly in the manufacturing industry. Robotics engineers may work in the agricultural, military, medical, and manufacturing industries, developing new uses for robots, designing improved robots for existing systems, or repairing and maintaining industrial robots.
