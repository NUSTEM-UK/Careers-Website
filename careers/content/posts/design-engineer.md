<span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">Design engineers create the initial blueprints and schematics for various structures, systems, machines, or equipment. Design engineers research using mathematical modelling to work through new developments and innovations. They turn research ideas into technical plans for prototypes using computer-aided design and computer-assisted engineering. They collect and analyse data from prototype testing, modifying designs ahead of manufacture or installation. Designer engineers are employed in many different industries including research and development companies, construction firms and product manufacturing plants.</span></span>
