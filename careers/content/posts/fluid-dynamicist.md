Fluid Dynamists are interested in the flow and movement of fluids and gases and the forces that affect this. Fluid dynamists study the evolution of stars, ocean currents, weather patterns, plate tectonics and blood circulation. Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting weather patterns, understanding nebulae in interstellar space and modelling fission weapon detonation. Some important technological applications of fluid dynamics include rocket engines, wind turbines, oil pipelines and air conditioning systems.
