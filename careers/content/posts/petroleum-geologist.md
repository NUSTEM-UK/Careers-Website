Petroleum geologists deal with natural reserves of combustible fuel on both land and sea and are responsible for gauging how much of this can be extracted. They discover the location and amount of useful fuel in sediments or reservoirs using technology such as geochemical analysis, ground-based sonar and satellite mapping. Petroleum geologists interpret geophysical information, conduct field studies, interpret and implement drilling strategies for extraction and create post-project reports. Petroleum geologists may work with oil companies in the supervising of the oil extraction process.
