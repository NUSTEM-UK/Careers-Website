Entomology is the study of insects, their relationships with other animals, environments and human beings. Entomologists contribute to scientific knowledge by finding the best ways to pollinate crops, conserve insect species, and protect crops, trees, wildlife, and livestock from pests. They may specialise in particular fields. Structural entomologists study insects found in buildings such as cockroaches, finding ways to prevent them from entering and how to get rid of them. Forensic entomologists help solve murder cases by studying the insects found on dead bodies to determine the timeline and location of a crime. Medical entomologists research ways to prevent the spread of diseases like West Nile Virus from insects to people.
