Magnetic engineers design magnets or machines and devices that use magnets. These may be used in computer data storage, compasses, doorbells and alarm systems, microphones and speakers, motors, electrical generators and electrical transformers. They are also used in medical equipment such as MRI scanners. After a magnet has been designed, magnet engineers define manufacturing processes and testing strategies then analysing test results and present them in the form of operating instructions and manuals.
