A live sound engineer works at live events to make sure the sound is of appropriate value and high quality. Live sound engineers work in music, theatres, conferences, sports and other events that require sound projection. They work with producers to identify places where changes in sound level are required. Sound engineers are responsible for pre-recording sound effects needed, the wireless microphones used and the sound that performers hear on their monitors during a live event.

<strong>Attributes: </strong>hard-working, patient, imaginative
