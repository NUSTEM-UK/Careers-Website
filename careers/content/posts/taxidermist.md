A taxidermist stuffs and mounts deceased animals to be displayed. They use a scalpel and precision scissors to remove an animal's hide, feathers, or scales. Taxidermist them use salt and chemicals such as ammonium alum, potassium alum and aluminium sulphate to preserve and soften the hide, which is left to dry in a kiln or open air. They then use clay or foam to create a cast from the mould, and attach the hide to the artificial figure. The taxidermist then inserts artificial eyes, teeth, and claws and secures the animal to a plaque or mount.
