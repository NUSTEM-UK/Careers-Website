A laser engineer is a scientist or engineer who has extensive training in designing, building, operating, and maintaining high-energy manufacturing or research laser equipment. Laser stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Laser light has a specific wavelength and is concentrated in a narrow beam of very high-intensity light which can focus very accurately. Laser engineers can develop medical lasers which treat or remove tissues or scientific lasers which are used in areas such as laser scanners, nuclear fusion or microscopy. They may be involved with military uses of lasers which include guidance, target designation and directly as energy weapons, or with industrial and commercial uses such as entertainment, surveying or bird deterrents.
