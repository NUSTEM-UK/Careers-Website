<span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">Herpetology veterinarians specialise in the care of reptiles and amphibians. As with a general veterinarian, herpetology veterinarians diagnose and treat sick and injured animals, perform operations, carry out tests such as blood analysis, X-rays and scans, provide care for an animal in veterinary hospitals and carrying out regular health checks for reptiles. Herpetology veterinarians also need to supervise veterinary nurses and support staff and communicate with pet owners.</span></span>
