Mechatronic engineers combine aspects of both mechanical engineering and robotic engineering into one discipline, called mechatronic engineering. They create smart machines that have an awareness of their surroundings for many different purposes and industries. Mechatronic engineers are involved in the entire development of smart machines, from design and testing to manufacture. Mechatronic engineers may work in a lab, processing plant or engineering office. They may be involved developing in robotics, bio-engineering, nanotechnology or in manufacturing unmanned vehicles or medical machines.
