An arborist studies the bio-mechanics of trees, their growth, cultivation, reactions to pruning, diseases and decay. They manage and study of individual trees, shrubs, vines, and other perennial woody plants and care for the health of the entire tree. Arborists maintain and care for trees as if left untouched they could cause damage, such as growing onto power lines or people's homes or causing damage in severe weather which leads to power outages and harmful collapses. An arborist provides other services such as insect control, fertilisation, cabling, aeration, lightning protection and canÂ identify any diseases or parasites.
