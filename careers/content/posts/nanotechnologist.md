Nanotechnology is chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, engineering and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanotechnologists find ways to deliberately make materials at nanoscale to take advantage of their enhanced properties such as higher strength and weight, increased control of light spectrum, and greater chemical reactivity than their larger-scale counterparts. They also look at how matter and particles can be changed or manipulated and altered at nanoscale and the affect that these alterations have on the overall molecule or piece of matter.
