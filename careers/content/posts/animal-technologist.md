Animal technologists work in research and development laboratories where they are responsible for the care of animals such as rats and rabbits, which are used in labs for medical and pharmaceutical research. As well as ensuring the welfare, food, hygiene and health of the animals meets the required standards, an animal technologist also needs to make sure that the lab environment meets the requirements of the experiments to be conducted. An animal technologist will also take samples, make observations and make detailed records of changes in animal behaviour.
