Veterinary physiotherapists work alongside veterinary surgeons to help reduce pain, improve mobility and prevent recurrence or injury in animals. The most common animals referred for physiotherapy are horses and dogs including working animals such as race horses and greyhounds. Other animals such as cats and some farm or zoo animals may require physiotherapy. Veterinary physiotherapists will plan exercise programmes, use manual and electro-therapy methods to reduce pain and help with movement, apply massage and hydrotherapy techniques and give advice on changes to animals' environments.
