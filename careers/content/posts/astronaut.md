Astronauts are trained by different space agencies such as NASA in order to command, pilot or serve as a crew member aboard spacecraft and the International Space Station. While in space, as well as exercising for around two and a half hours a day, astronauts are responsible for maintaining the air filters, oxygen production systems, water and waste disposal systems. They must also replace worn or broken parts of the spacecraft. Astronauts carry out scientific experiments and research while in space and transfer data and reports to Earth via satellite.
